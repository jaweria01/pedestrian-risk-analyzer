# pedestrian-risk-analyzer
This repo presents a prototype pedestrian safety system that predicts distraction risk using contextual behavioral data. It uses a ML model trained on features like walking speed, phone usage, head posture, and traffic density. An interactive Streamlit app shows how such context-aware systems can support real-time safety alerts for pedestrians.
