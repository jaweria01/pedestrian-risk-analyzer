# Context-Aware Pedestrian Risk Analyzer

This project presents a prototype context-aware intervention system that predicts pedestrian distraction risk using simulated mobile sensing features.

## Motivation
Pedestrian safety is increasingly affected by mobile distraction. This project explores how contextual signals such as phone usage, walking speed, head posture, and traffic density can be used to predict unsafe situations and trigger preventive alerts.

## Features
- Machine learning–based risk prediction model
- Context-aware decision logic
- Interactive web interface (Streamlit prototype)
- Demonstrates safety intervention in cyber-physical environments

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Streamlit

## How to Run

```bash
py -3.11 -m streamlit run app.py
